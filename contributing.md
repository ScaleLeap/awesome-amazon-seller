## How to contribute a resource?

### Pull request

If you are technically-savvy, you can create a pull request on GitHub and add a resource. Please mention why you think the resource is awesome in the description of the PR.

### Open an issue

If you do not know how to open a pull request, you can get a free account on GitHub and [open an issue](https://github.com/ScaleLeap/awesome-amazon-seller/issues/new) with your suggestion. Please explain why the resource is awesome.

## Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

### Do

- Make sure your submission is awesome, and not just average.
- If you are sending a PR, make sure you insert the resource in alphabetical order.
- Tone down the marketing in the description. Try to stay factual.

### Do Not

- Submit spam.
- Submit guru courses.
- Submit affiliate links.

Thank you for your suggestions!

## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
